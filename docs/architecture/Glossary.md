# Glossary

## Purpose

This document defines canonical terms used across OurBox OS architecture, ADRs, code, and docs.

**Rule:** one concept gets one term. Avoid overloaded words. In particular:
- “Dataset” is reserved for GraphMD conversations and is not used as an OurBox OS storage term.
- “Domain” is avoided (confusable with DNS domains).
- “Namespace” is reserved for Kubernetes namespaces.

If anything conflicts with this document’s vocabulary, this document wins (for terminology).

## Core terms

### OurBox instance
A single physical/logical OurBox device running OurBox OS.

### OurBox OS
The operating system + platform services shipped on an OurBox instance.

### box-host
The base host name used to address an OurBox instance on a network.

Examples (informative):
- local network name: `ourbox.local` (mDNS-style)
- user-chosen home DNS name: `ourbox.home`
- user-chosen public DNS name: `box.example.com`

OurBox may be deployed on a LAN only or exposed via port forwarding / reverse proxy. This document
does not mandate a deployment posture; it standardizes how names are used.

### origin
A web security boundary defined by `(scheme, host, port)`. Origins isolate:
- IndexedDB and related browser storage,
- Cache Storage,
- service workers.

OurBox uses tenant-in-hostname so each tenant is a distinct origin.

### Operator Truth
The posture that the device operator (physical/root/update control) can access anything on the box
if they choose to, and may be able to exfiltrate content from clients (e.g., from browser storage).
Our boundaries are for correct product behavior and legibility, not hostile-admin confidentiality.

## Identity and boundary terms

### Tenant
The top-level data boundary in OurBox OS (ADR-0003).

- Tenant context scopes data, access checks, and replication targets.
- Each tenant has exactly one **tenant DB** (ADR-0002).

### Tenancy
The set of one or more tenants hosted on a single OurBox instance.

### tenant_id
Stable identifier for a tenant.

Constraints (normative):
- SHALL be lowercase.
- SHALL be safe for use in DNS labels (tenant subdomains).
- SHALL be safe for use in CouchDB database names.

Examples: `bob`, `alice`, `family`, `roommates-2026`

### Tenant origin
A tenant-scoped browser origin derived from hostname:

- `https://<tenant_id>.<box-host>/...`

Tenant origins are distinct web origins and therefore isolate:
- IndexedDB (PouchDB storage)
- Cache Storage (service worker caches)
- service worker scope

This isolation is a core mechanism for safe multi-tenant use on shared devices.

### User
An authenticated actor identity (“who is making this request?”).

- Users may be members of one or more tenants.
- Users and tenants are distinct concepts even if there is a 1:1 personal-tenant default.

### user_id
The canonical identifier for a user identity.

In OurBox OS, `user_id` is a **human-readable handle**.

Normative rules:
- `user_id` SHALL be unique within an OurBox instance.
- `user_id` SHOULD be treated as stable/immutable once created.
  - Renaming a `user_id` is a migration and SHALL be explicit.
- `user_id` values are not reusable by default.
  - If user `joe` leaves a shared box, a future different person must choose a different `user_id`
    (e.g., `joe2`, `joe-smith`).
- `user_id` SHALL be safe for use in URLs, logs, and configuration.
  - Recommended pattern: lowercase DNS-label-ish tokens (letters, numbers, hyphen/underscore), no spaces.

### display_name (optional)
A user-facing string that may contain spaces, capitalization, etc.
`display_name` is presentation-only and SHALL NOT be used as an identifier.

### Tenant membership
A relationship between a user and a tenant that grants capabilities within that tenant context.

### role
A named grouping of capabilities used to evaluate authorization within a tenant context.

Examples (informative): `owner`, `editor`, `viewer`.

### capability
A fine-grained permission used to evaluate authorization within a tenant context.

Examples (informative): `notes:read`, `notes:write`, `tasks:write`.

(OurBox may implement roles as bundles of capabilities.)

## App and deployment terms

### App
A user-facing browser experience (a shipped OurBox PWA) reachable under a tenant origin at an app route.

Apps are experiences. Apps are replaceable. Apps do not define data boundaries.

### shipped app
A first-party OurBox app distributed as part of OurBox OS that SHALL conform to ADR-0001 posture.

### app_slug
The path portion that identifies an app experience under a tenant origin.

Examples: `/simplenote`, `/richnote`, `/tasks`, `/calendar`

### Kubernetes namespace
A Kubernetes/k3s operational partition.

Reserved word (normative): “namespace” refers only to Kubernetes namespaces in OurBox OS documentation.

### App namespace (Kubernetes)
A Kubernetes namespace used for operational grouping of an app’s workloads.

- Recommended: one Kubernetes namespace per shipped app workload bundle.
- Not all Kubernetes namespaces correspond to apps (platform/system namespaces exist).
- Tenants are not Kubernetes namespaces.

## Storage and sync terms

### CouchDB
The document database running on the box, acting as the system-of-record and replication target for shipped apps.

### PouchDB
The document database running in the browser, backed by IndexedDB, acting as the local working store for offline-first apps.

### Tenant DB
A CouchDB database that stores all application documents for one tenant (ADR-0002).

- Recommended naming: `tenant_<tenant_id>` (e.g., `tenant_bob`)
- Replication unit: tenant DB ↔ tenant DB (whole-DB replication is the norm).
- Each tenant also has exactly one tenant blob store used for blob payload bytes outside CouchDB.

### Local tenant replica
The single PouchDB database within a tenant origin that acts as the local replica of the tenant DB.

All shipped apps under the same tenant origin SHALL use the same local tenant replica so they share doc kinds offline.

### Partitioned database (CouchDB partitions)
A CouchDB database created in partitioned mode. In a partitioned database:
- Application document `_id` SHALL be shaped as: `<partitionKey>:<docId>`

### Partition key
The prefix of a partitioned document `_id` before the first `:`.

In OurBox OS, the partition key is the **doc kind**.

### Document
A single JSON object stored in CouchDB/PouchDB. Documents are the atomic unit of:
- read/write
- replication
- conflicts (concurrent edits on the same doc)

### _id
The immutable primary identifier of an application document.

In OurBox OS tenant DBs (ADR-0004):
- `_id = "<doc_kind>:<doc_uuid>"`
- Example: `note:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

### doc kind
The canonical document classification used by OurBox OS. It is derived from `_id` only.

Initial stable vocabulary (normative for shipped apps):
- `note`, `task`, `contact`, `event`, `meta`

### doc_uuid
The UUIDv4 portion of `_id` after `<doc_kind>:`.

### _rev (revision)
CouchDB/PouchDB revision identifier for a specific version of a document. Each update produces a new revision.

### conflict
A situation where concurrent edits produce multiple revisions that must be resolved according to policy.

### replication
Incremental, resumable synchronization of documents and revisions between two databases that support the CouchDB replication protocol.

### replication source
The database endpoint from which changes are read during a replication run.

### replication target
The database endpoint to which changes are written during a replication run.

Note: replication targets are not “backups.” Replication can copy deletions and bad changes.

### backup (distinct from replication)
Point-in-time retention (snapshots/archives). Replication is not backup.

## Blob and storage terms

### blob
Large binary content (photos/video/audio/etc.) stored outside CouchDB by default in the **tenant blob store** (one blob store per tenant) (ADR-0002, ADR-0005). Documents store references (e.g., CIDs); the tenant blob store stores payload bytes.

### content-addressed storage (CAS)
A storage approach where blob identifiers are derived from the content (e.g., a hash) rather than a mutable name.

### tenant blob store
A tenant-scoped content-addressed blob store used to store blob payload bytes outside CouchDB.

Normative:
- Each tenant has exactly one tenant blob store on an OurBox instance.
- Blob payload bytes belong to exactly one tenant and are stored in that tenant's blob store.

### tenant storage root
An implementation-chosen filesystem directory or object-store prefix that serves as the root of a tenant's blob store. Blob Paths (ADR-0006) are relative to this root.

## Web platform terms

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
A web application that can be installed and can provide offline capability using web platform features
(e.g., service worker, Cache Storage, IndexedDB).

### service worker
A background script registered by a web app that can intercept network requests and manage offline
caches for an origin/scope.

### IndexedDB
The browser storage API used by PouchDB for local persistence.

## Routing and enforcement

### Gateway
The front door for HTTP(S) traffic to the box, responsible for:
- routing (host + path)
- authentication and authorization enforcement
- deriving tenant context from hostname
- presenting stable endpoints for apps and replication
- injecting validated identity context to internal services

---

## Cross-document rule
All ADRs and architecture docs SHALL use these terms and avoid:
- “dataset” (unless explicitly discussing GraphMD)
- “domain” (unqualified)
- “namespace” for anything other than Kubernetes namespaces
