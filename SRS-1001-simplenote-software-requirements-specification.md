# SRS-1001: SimpleNote Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Draft

This specification defines the software requirements for the SimpleNote application.

This is intentionally minimal scaffolding; requirements will be added iteratively.

## Normative Language

Normative keywords (SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY) are defined in
`docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

## Introduction

This SRS defines the requirements for the SimpleNote application software item.

SimpleNote is a user-facing application. Detailed requirements will be added iteratively.

## Requirements

This section will be populated with SimpleNote software requirements.

Typical groupings (to be filled in later):
- Allocated System Requirements (from SyRS)
- Functional Requirements
- Data Requirements
- Quality Requirements (NFRs)
- Constraints

## Verification

Verification provisions (methods, environments, and trace links to evidence) will be defined here.
Verification methods are defined in `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

## External Interfaces

Simplenote external interfaces are mode-aware tenant-origin surfaces.

- App routes:
  - local-only mode: `http://<tenant_id>.local/simplenote`
  - public custom-domain mode: `https://<tenant_id>.<box-host>/simplenote`
- Replication endpoints:
  - `http://<tenant_id>.local/db`
  - `https://<tenant_id>.<box-host>/db`
- Local storage: shared local tenant replica `tenant_local` within one origin

Full installable-PWA posture is scoped to public custom-domain mode. Local-only mode is HTTP local mode with local data continuity and opportunistic sync while reachable.
