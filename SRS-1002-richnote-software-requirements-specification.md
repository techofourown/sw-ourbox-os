This specification defines the software requirements for the RichNote application.

This is intentionally minimal scaffolding; requirements will be added iteratively.

Normative keywords (SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY) are defined in
`docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

## External Interfaces

External interfaces (UI surface expectations, APIs consumed, replication endpoints, etc.) will be
