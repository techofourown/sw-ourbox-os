to be considered complete and acceptable.

### Allocation
Assignment of a system-level requirement to one or more system elements (e.g., subsystems,
components, software items) responsible for satisfying it.

### Assumption
A statement accepted as true for planning or design purposes. Assumptions should be explicitly
identified because they can become risks if invalid.

### Architecture

relationships, and the principles of its design and evolution.

### Architecture Description (AD)
A work product that expresses an architecture for specific stakeholders and concerns using one or
more views (and associated viewpoints).

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
A lightweight record of a significant architectural decision, including context, decision, and

A requirement that results from analysis, decomposition, or design decisions, and is traceable back
to a parent requirement or stakeholder need.

### Design

structures, interfaces, behaviors, and implementation choices.

### Document identifier
A unique identifier assigned to a document or record to support traceability, configuration
management, and referencing.

provide.

### Hazard
A system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environmental
conditions, will lead to an accident or loss event.

### High-Level Requirement (HLR)

### Quality attribute (QA)
A measurable or assessable property of a system that affects its quality (e.g., reliability,
usability, performance, security).

### Requirement
A statement that translates or expresses a need and its associated constraints and conditions.
Requirements should be necessary, unambiguous, verifiable, and traceable.

### Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

Typically characterized by likelihood and consequence (impact).

### Stakeholder
An individual or organization that has a right, share, or interest in the system, or is affected by
the system.

# SyRS-0001: OurBox OS System Requirements Specification

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Draft

This specification is an early, intentionally small set of normative requirements derived from:
- architecture docs ([[arch_doc:AD-0001]])
- decisions ([[adr:ADR-0001]]..[[adr:ADR-0004]])

It is compiled from GraphMD records into `SyRS-0001-ourbox-os-system-requirements-specification.md`.

## Normative Language

The key words **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are to be interpreted as
requirements. When a requirement references a record, that record is part of the normative context.

## Application Requirements

These requirements describe the baseline posture for shipped OurBox applications operating within a
single tenant origin, including offline-first behavior and doc-kind handling.

### APP-001: Shipped apps SHALL be offline-first PWAs

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** app  
**Rationale:** Aligns shipped apps with ADR-0001 posture.

Shipped OurBox apps SHALL be installable PWAs that can load from cache after the first successful
online session.

### APP-002: Shipped apps SHALL persist working data locally

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** app  
**Rationale:** Offline writes depend on local persistence.

Shipped apps SHALL store working data locally in the tenant origin using PouchDB-backed IndexedDB.

### APP-003: Shipped apps SHALL sync opportunistically

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** app  
**Rationale:** Supports sporadic connectivity while keeping data consistent.

Shipped apps SHALL initiate incremental replication with the tenant DB when connectivity is available.

### APP-004: Apps SHALL operate within a tenant origin

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** app  
**Rationale:** Tenant origins define storage isolation and routing.

Shipped apps SHALL be served under `https://<tenant_id>.<box-host>/<app_slug>` and derive tenant
context from the hostname.

### APP-005: Apps SHALL share one local tenant replica per origin

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** app  
**Rationale:** Ensures apps share doc kinds offline.

All shipped apps under the same tenant origin SHALL read and write through a single local tenant
replica database on that device.

### APP-006: Apps SHALL honor doc-kind contracts

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** app  
**Rationale:** Shared storage requires strict doc-kind boundaries.

Shipped apps SHALL only create and update documents whose `_id` prefixes match the stable doc-kind
vocabulary defined for OurBox OS.

## Data and Replication

These requirements capture the canonical data modeling and replication posture for tenant databases
and local replicas.

### DATA-001: Each tenant SHALL have exactly one tenant DB

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Tenant DBs are the replication unit.

OurBox SHALL maintain one CouchDB database per tenant, named using the `tenant_<tenant_id>` pattern.

### DATA-002: Tenant DBs SHALL be partitioned databases

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Partitioning enforces doc-kind boundaries.

All tenant databases SHALL be created as CouchDB partitioned databases.

### DATA-003: Document IDs SHALL use the doc_kind:uuidv4 scheme

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Canonical IDs ensure consistent replication and conflict boundaries.

Application documents SHALL have `_id` values shaped as `<doc_kind>:<uuidv4>` and SHALL NOT use ULIDs.

### DATA-004: Doc kind SHALL be derived from _id only

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Avoids divergent sources of truth for document classification.

Applications and services SHALL derive `doc_kind` from the `_id` prefix and SHALL NOT store a separate
doc-type field as the authoritative source.

### DATA-005: Tenant replication SHALL be whole-DB

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Replication posture is tenant DB ↔ tenant DB.

Replication between client devices and the box SHALL use the tenant DB as the unit of replication and
SHALL NOT require selective partition replication.

### DATA-006: Blobs SHALL be stored outside CouchDB by default

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Large binary content should not be default CouchDB attachments.

Large binary assets (photos/video/audio) SHALL be stored outside CouchDB by default with references
stored in application documents.

## Gateway and Identity

These requirements define tenant routing, identity enforcement, and the gateway surface used by
clients and shipped apps.

### GW-001: Gateway SHALL derive tenant context from hostname

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** gateway  
**Rationale:** Tenant origins are the canonical boundary.

The gateway SHALL derive `tenant_id` from the request hostname and treat it as the authoritative
tenant context.

### GW-002: Gateway SHALL enforce tenant membership

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** gateway  
**Rationale:** Ensures user access is scoped to the tenant origin.

The gateway SHALL enforce that authenticated users are members of the tenant implied by the hostname
before allowing access to tenant-scoped services.

### GW-003: Replication endpoints SHALL be same-origin

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** gateway  
**Rationale:** Browser clients must replicate without CORS or topology leakage.

The gateway SHALL expose replication at `/db` on the tenant origin and SHALL NOT require clients to
know internal CouchDB endpoints.

## Kubernetes and Deployment

These requirements describe the k3s/Kubernetes posture for deploying OurBox OS services and shipped
apps while preserving tenant boundaries.

### K8S-001: Kubernetes namespaces SHALL NOT encode tenant boundaries

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** k8s  
**Rationale:** Tenant is a data boundary, not an operational namespace.

Kubernetes namespaces SHALL be used for operational grouping and SHALL NOT be treated as the primary
tenant isolation boundary.

### K8S-002: Gateway ingress SHALL support wildcard tenant hosts

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** k8s  
**Rationale:** Tenant origins rely on hostname routing.

Ingress configuration SHALL support wildcard host routing for `*.<box-host>` to enable tenant
subdomains.

### K8S-003: Shipped app workloads SHOULD use dedicated namespaces

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** false  
**Area:** k8s  
**Rationale:** Separates app operations while keeping tenant boundaries intact.

Shipped app workload bundles SHOULD run in their own Kubernetes namespaces to simplify operations
and isolation from platform services.
