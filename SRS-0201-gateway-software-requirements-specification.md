# SRS-0201: Gateway Software Requirements Specification\n\n**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)\n**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28\n**Status:** Draft\n\nThis specification defines the software requirements for the Gateway software item.

This is intentionally minimal scaffolding; requirements will be added iteratively.\n\n## Normative Language\n\nNormative keywords (SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY) are defined in
`docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis SRS defines the requirements for the Gateway software item.

The Gateway is the externally-facing software element responsible for request routing and policy
enforcement at system boundaries. Detailed requirements will be added iteratively.\n\n## Referenced Documents\n\n- `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`

Typical groupings (to be filled in later):
- Functional Requirements
- Quality Requirements (NFRs)
- Constraints
- Security/Authorization Requirements
- Operational/Deployment Constraints\n\n## External Interfaces\n\nExternal interfaces (HTTP APIs, endpoints, protocols, headers, identity context propagation, etc.)
will be specified via Interface Control Documents (ICDs) and referenced here.\n\n## Verification\n\nVerification provisions (methods, environments, and trace links to evidence) will be defined here.
Verification methods are defined in `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.\n\n
