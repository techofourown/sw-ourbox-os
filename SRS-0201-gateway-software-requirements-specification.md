# SRS-0201: Gateway Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Draft

This specification defines the software requirements for the Gateway software item.

This is intentionally minimal scaffolding; requirements will be added iteratively.

## Normative Language

Normative keywords (SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY) are defined in
`docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

## Introduction

This SRS defines the requirements for the Gateway software item.

The Gateway is the externally-facing software element responsible for request routing and policy
enforcement at system boundaries. Detailed requirements will be added iteratively.

## Requirements

This section will be populated with Gateway software requirements.

Typical groupings (to be filled in later):
- Functional Requirements
- Quality Requirements (NFRs)
- Constraints
- Security/Authorization Requirements
- Operational/Deployment Constraints

## External Interfaces

External interfaces (HTTP APIs, endpoints, protocols, headers, identity context propagation, etc.)
will be specified via Interface Control Documents (ICDs) and referenced here.

## Verification

Verification provisions (methods, environments, and trace links to evidence) will be defined here.
Verification methods are defined in `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.
