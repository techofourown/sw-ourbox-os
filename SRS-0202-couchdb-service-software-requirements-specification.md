# SRS-0202: CouchDB Service Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Draft

This specification defines the software requirements for the on-box **CouchDB service** (system-of-record for tenant DBs). It is a minimal scaffold; detailed requirements live in section records and the authoritative Glossary.

## Normative Language

Normative keywords (SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY) and OurBox OS product/architecture vocabulary are defined in `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

## Introduction

This SRS defines requirements for the **on-box CouchDB service**, which acts as the tenant-scoped system-of-record and replication target.

Scope includes:
- tenant DB creation and naming posture (`tenant_<tenant_id>`)
- partitioned database posture and `_id` scheme
- replication posture at the database level (tenant DB ↔ tenant DB)
- tenant storage contract boundaries for CouchDB usage

Out of scope:
- gateway routing, `/db` mapping, and host/path policy (see `[[spec:SRS-0201]]`)
- client local replicas and PouchDB behavior (see `[[spec:SRS-0204]]`)
- tenant blob store requirements (see `[[spec:SRS-0205]]`)

This SRS is intentionally a minimal scaffold, but it pulls in the already-established requirements from:
- `[[spec:SyRS-0001]]` (system requirements for data/replication), and
- `[[arch_doc:AD-0001]]` (architecture invariants for storage/replication posture).

## Requirements

Allocated system requirements from `[[spec:SyRS-0001]]` are included here for traceability; CouchDB-service-specific requirements follow.

### DATA-001: Each tenant SHALL have exactly one tenant DB

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Tenant DBs are the replication unit for data modeling and replication.

OurBox SHALL maintain one CouchDB database per tenant, named using the `tenant_<tenant_id>` pattern.

### DATA-002: Tenant DBs SHALL be partitioned databases

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Partitioning enforces doc-kind boundaries.

All tenant databases SHALL be created as CouchDB partitioned databases.

### DATA-003: Document IDs SHALL use the doc_kind:uuidv4 scheme

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Canonical IDs ensure consistent replication and conflict boundaries.

Application documents SHALL have `_id` values shaped as `<doc_kind>:<uuidv4>`.

### DATA-004: Doc kind SHALL be derived from _id only

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Avoids divergent sources of truth for document classification.

Applications and services SHALL derive `doc_kind` from the `_id` prefix and SHALL NOT store a separate
doc-type field as the authoritative source.

### DATA-005: Tenant replication SHALL be whole-DB

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Replication posture is tenant DB ↔ tenant DB.

Replication between client devices and the box SHALL use the tenant DB as the unit of replication and
SHALL NOT require selective partition replication.

### DATA-006: Blobs SHALL be stored outside CouchDB by default

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Large binary content should not be default CouchDB attachments; tenant-scoped blob stores enable legible tenant operations.

Large binary assets (photos/video/audio) SHALL be stored outside CouchDB by default in the tenant blob store (one blob store per tenant), with references stored in application documents.

### DATA-007: Each tenant SHALL have exactly one tenant blob store

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Tenant-scoped blob stores keep blob payload bytes legible for tenant operations and align with ADR-0006 storage roots.

OurBox SHALL maintain one tenant blob store per tenant for blob payload bytes stored outside CouchDB.

Each tenant blob store SHALL use a tenant-scoped storage root (ADR-0006).

### K8S-005: CouchDB SHALL run as a k3s workload

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** k8s  
**Rationale:** ADR-0007 establishes that CouchDB runs as a k3s workload for consistent appliance operations.

The CouchDB service SHALL be deployed and managed as a Kubernetes workload in the on-box k3s cluster and SHALL NOT be operated as an unmanaged host-level daemon.

**Trace:** [[adr:ADR-0007]]

### K8S-006: CouchDB data SHALL be stored on persistent volumes

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** k8s  
**Rationale:** CouchDB is the system-of-record; when deployed in k3s its data must survive pod restarts and rescheduling.

The CouchDB workload SHALL store CouchDB data files on persistent storage provided via Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim(s).

CouchDB SHALL NOT store system-of-record data only on ephemeral container filesystem storage.

**Trace:** [[adr:ADR-0007]]

### BOXDB-001: Replication SHALL use the standard CouchDB API and replication protocol

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Preserves interoperability across many clients and enables future peer replication without proprietary protocols.

Replication between clients and the box SHALL use the standard CouchDB HTTP API and replication protocol.

**Trace:** [[arch_doc:AD-0001]] §4.5

### BOXDB-002: Replication SHALL be treated as synchronization, not backup

**Status:** Draft  
**Testable:** true  
**Area:** data  
**Rationale:** Replication can copy deletions and bad changes; backup must be point-in-time retention.

Replication SHALL be treated as availability/synchronization behavior and SHALL NOT be treated as backup.

**Trace:** [[arch_doc:AD-0001]] §7.1

## External Interfaces

The CouchDB service is treated as internal infrastructure.

Client-facing replication endpoints are presented via the Gateway on tenant origins (see `[[spec:SRS-0201]]`). Any direct CouchDB node/admin surface is intentionally out of scope for client access.

Concrete in-cluster service interfaces (Service names, ports, authentication material, internal URLs, and any network policy)
are defined by the versioned deployment baseline manifests and are discoverable via cluster inspection (ADR-0008).

Any additional protocol-level contracts introduced between services (beyond what the deployment baseline expresses) are defined
as machine-readable contract artifacts (OpenAPI/JSON schema) and verified by automated tests.

## Verification

Verification methods are defined in `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

Initial verification posture:
- **Inspection:** tenant DB naming, partitioned mode configuration, and blob-store posture.
- **Test:** replication between a client and the box using the tenant DB as the unit of replication.
