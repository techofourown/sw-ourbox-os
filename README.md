# OurBox OS

OurBox OS is **a local-first application platform** that runs on **user-owned hardware** (or
user-owned cloud VMs) and presents a **mobile-first, phone-like web experience** for launching and
using self-hosted apps.

It is called an "OS" because it behaves like a cohesive operating environment:
- a home screen ("Launcher")
- a set of canonical first-party apps (Email, Notes, Contacts, Photos, Messaging, Settings, etc.)
- an app catalog / installation model
- shared identity, permissions, and data foundations

...but it is **not** an operating system distribution or kernel.
