This SRS defines the requirements for the **Gateway** software item.

The Gateway is the **front door for HTTP(S) traffic** to an OurBox instance. It is responsible for tenant-scoped routing and policy enforcement, including exposing a stable same-origin replication surface for CouchDB while also routing app and API traffic under tenant origins.

This SRS intentionally remains a minimal scaffold, but it includes the Gateway requirements already established in:
- `[[spec:SyRS-0001]]` (system requirements allocated to the Gateway), and
- `[[arch_doc:AD-0001]]` (normative architecture invariants and routing posture).
