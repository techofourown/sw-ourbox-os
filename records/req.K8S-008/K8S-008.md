  title: "Platform workloads SHOULD use dedicated system namespaces"
  status: "Draft"
  testable: true
  area: "k8s"
  rationale: "AD-0001 recommends a small set of namespaces for platform workloads and app workloads for operational legibility."
  order: 50

Shared multi-tenant platform workloads (e.g., gateway, CouchDB, platform services) SHOULD run in a small set of dedicated Kubernetes namespaces (e.g., `ourbox-system`, `ourbox-platform`).

Shipped app workload bundles SHOULD run in app-specific Kubernetes namespaces (e.g., `app-simplenote`, `app-richnote`).

**Trace:** [[arch_doc:AD-0001]] §5.4.1
