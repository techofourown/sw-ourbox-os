This SRS defines requirements for the **on-box CouchDB service**, which acts as the tenant-scoped system-of-record and replication target.

Scope includes:
- tenant DB creation and naming posture (`tenant_<tenant_id>`)
- partitioned database posture and `_id` scheme
- replication posture at the database level (tenant DB ↔ tenant DB)
- on-box blob-store posture insofar as it is part of the tenant storage contract

Out of scope:
- gateway routing, `/db` mapping, and host/path policy (see `[[spec:SRS-0201]]`)
- client local replicas and PouchDB behavior (see `[[spec:SRS-0204]]`)

This SRS is intentionally a minimal scaffold, but it pulls in the already-established requirements from:
- `[[spec:SyRS-0001]]` (system requirements for data/replication), and
- `[[arch_doc:AD-0001]]` (architecture invariants for storage/replication posture).
