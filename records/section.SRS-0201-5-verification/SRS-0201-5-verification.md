Verification methods are defined in `docs/00-Glossary/Terms-and-Definitions.md`.

Initial verification posture for this SRS:
- **Inspection:** confirm Gateway configuration supports wildcard hosts and path routing shapes (GW-004..GW-006).
- **Test:** automated integration tests that validate hostname→tenant mapping and membership gating (GW-001..GW-003, GW-007..GW-009).
- Evidence artifacts (test outputs, config snapshots, and release manifests) will be linked here as they are produced.
